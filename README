bashtrash - a bash-shell implementation of the Freedesktop.org
            trashcan specification.

This project was originally a quick hack to show that one could
implement a compliant trashcan utility using bash and standard Unix
commands.  It has evolved to have options to make it (somewhat)
compatible as a replacement for rm.

It requires the following utilities:

  awk
  basename
  bash
  cat
  getopt
  mkdir
  mktemp
  mv
  sed

Usage: trash [OPTION]... FILE...

Move files into the trash.

Options:
  --version	show program's version number and exit
  -h		show this help message and exit
  -v		explain what is being done
  -i		prompt before moving every file
  -r, -R	ignored (for compatability with rm)
  -f		ignore non-existent files, never prompt
